abstract = {Dark patterns are an abuse of the tremendous power that designers hold in their hands. As public awareness of dark patterns grows, so does the potential fallout. Journalists and academics have been scrutinizing dark patterns, and the backlash from these exposures can destroy brand reputations and bring companies under the lenses of regulators. Design is power. In the past decade, software engineers have had to confront the fact that the power they hold comes with responsibilities to users and to society. In this decade, it is time for designers to learn this lesson as well.},

abstract = {As 5G and MEC technology become increasingly prevalent, Autonomous driving vehicles is probably one of the most highly anticipated things nowadays. This article begins with the background information on the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G networking, Mobile Edge Computation (MEC), and the methods that autonomous driving vehicle could use those technologies above. Comparing to the auto-driving system in the past (on-board electronics focused), current auto-driving vehicles will have better connectivity. Some of control theories and machine learning strategies will be discussed in detail in this article. In discussion part of the article, some predictions were made according to the future roles that autonomous car could play in the future "Smart City" eco-system. Based on the functionality that 5G networks and MEC devices could provide, autonomous driving vehicles would be more reliable than human drivers. However, they will not replace gasoline cars very soon. This article reviews the control theories and machine learning algorithm for autonomous driving system and it is expected to provide some suggestions for the future trend of this technology.},

abstract = {Due to the nature of smartphones' portability and mobility, many mobile apps are usually utilized in the real field environment using GPS, Wi-Fi and embedded sensors. For example, any navigation app uses GPS and Wi-Fi to locate the user in the map, and streaming apps may be used in cafeteria or even outside to satisfy the users' demand to watch soccer games anywhere and anytime. To test the usability and performance of such mobile apps in in-situ environment, we need to bring the apps to such physical world and run (a number of) test scenarios, which is often cost-inefficient depending on the size, apps and situations assumed in those scenarios. In this paper, we design and develop a testbed to test mobile apps in VR space. The system allows developers to use a real smartphone in VR and to test and evaluate their apps at the interested locations, with various network environment. The system builds and reproduces the real world environment of 3D space and real networks in the VR environment, using the existing 3D city models and our original Wi-Fi database. Then it enables to real-timely integrate the screen of the VR user's smartphone in the VR space. The user can operate the app via the VR view, and test the usability and performance of the app in such an emulated environment. The experimental result shows our architecture could achieve such cyber-physical integration with 695.5 ms delay, which is negligible in many semi-realtime services such as navigations.},

In this work, we analyze Dark Patterns in 240 popular mobile apps and conduct an online experiment with 589 users on how they perceive Dark Patterns in such apps. The results of the analysis show that 95\% of the analyzed apps contain one or more forms of Dark Patterns and, on average, popular applications include at least seven different types of deceiving interfaces. The online experiment shows that most users do not recognize Dark Patterns, but can perform better in recognizing malicious designs if informed on the issue. We discuss the impact of our work and what measures could be applied to alleviate the issue.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, pages = {1–14}, numpages = {14} }
